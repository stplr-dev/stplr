## Commands

### install

The install command installs a package from the LURE repos. Any packages that aren't found in LURE's repos get forwarded to the system package manager for installation.

The package arguments do not have to be exact. LURE will check the `provides` array if an exact match is not found. There is also support for using "%" as a wildcard.

If multiple packages are found, you will be prompted to select which you want to install.

By default, if a package has already been built, LURE will install the cached package rather than re-build it. Use the `-c` or `--clean` flag to force a re-build.

Examples:

```shell
lure in itd-bin # only finds itd-bin
lure in itd # finds itd-bin and itd-git
lure in it% # finds itd-bin, itd-git, and itgui-git
lure in -c itd-bin
```

### remove

The remove command is for convenience. All it does is forwards the remove command to the system package manager.

Example:

```shell
lure rm firefox
```

### upgrade

The upgrade command looks through the packages installed on your system and sees if any of them match LURE repo packages. If they do, their versions are compared using the `rpmvercmp` algorithm. If LURE repos contain a newer version, the package is upgraded.

By default, if a package has already been built, LURE will install the cached package rather than re-build it. Use the `-c` or `--clean` flag to force a re-build.

Example:

```shell
lure up
```

### info

The info command displays information about a package in LURE's repos.

The package arguments do not have to be exact. LURE will check the `provides` array if an exact match is not found. There is also support for using "%" as a wildcard.

If multiple packages are found, you will be prompted to select which you want to show.

Example:

```shell
lure info itd-bin # only finds itd-bin
lure info itd # finds itd-bin and itd-git
lure info it% # finds itd-bin, itd-git, and itgui-git
```

### list

The list command lists all LURE repo packages as well as their versions

This command accepts a single optional argument. This argument is a pattern to filter found packages against.

The pattern does not have to be exact. LURE will check the `provides` array if an exact match is not found. There is also support for using "%" as a wildcard.

There is a `-I` or `--installed` flag that filters out any packages that are not installed on the system

Examples:

```shell
lure ls # lists all LURE packages
lure ls -I # lists all installed packages
lure ls i% # lists all packages starting with "i"
lure ls %d # lists all packages ending with "d"
lure ls -I i% # lists all installed packages that start with "i"
```

### build

The build command builds a package using a `lure.sh` build script in the current directory. The path to the script can be changed with the `-s` flag.

Example:

```shell
lure build
```

### addrepo

The addrepo command adds a repository to LURE if it doesn't already exist. The `-n` flag sets the name of the repository, and the `-u` flag is the URL to the repository. Both are required.

Example:

```shell
lure ar -n default -u https://github.com/Elara6331/lure-repo
```

### removerepo

The removerepo command removes a repository from LURE and deletes its contents if it exists. The `-n` flag specifies the name of the repo to be deleted.

Example:

```shell
lure rr -n default
```

### refresh

The refresh command pulls all changes from all LURE repos that have changed.

Example:

```shell
lure ref
```

### fix

The fix command attempts to fix issues with LURE by deleting and rebuilding LURE's cache

Example:

```shell
lure fix
```

### version

The version command returns the current LURE version and exits

Example:

```shell
lure version
```

## Environment Variables

### LURE_DISTRO

The `LURE_DISTRO` environment variable should be set to the distro for which the package should be built. It tells LURE which overrides to use. Values should be the same as the `ID` field in `/etc/os-release` or `/usr/lib/os-release`. Possible values include:

- `arch`
- `alpine`
- `opensuse`
- `debian`

### LURE_PKG_FORMAT

The `LURE_PKG_FORMAT` environment variable should be set to the packaging format that should be used. Valid values are:

- `archlinux`
- `apk`
- `rpm`
- `deb`

### LURE_ARM_VARIANT

The `LURE_ARM_VARIANT` environment variable dictates which ARM variant to build for, if LURE is running on an ARM system. Possible values include:

- `arm5`
- `arm6`
- `arm7`

## Cross-packaging for other Distributions

You can create packages for different distributions  
setting the environment variables `LURE_DISTRO` and `LURE_PKG_FORMAT` as mentioned above.

Examples:

```
LURE_DISTRO=arch     LURE_PKG_FORMAT=archlinux lure build
LURE_DISTRO=alpine   LURE_PKG_FORMAT=apk       lure build
LURE_DISTRO=opensuse LURE_PKG_FORMAT=rpm       lure build
LURE_DISTRO=debian   LURE_PKG_FORMAT=deb       lure build
```
