# Stapler

Stapler is a universal package build and management system for Linux that makes installing programs easier and more convenient. It is a fork of the [ALR](https://gitea.plemya-x.ru/Plemya-x/ALR) project, which, in turn, is based on [LURE](https://lure.sh/). Stapler allows you to install packages from your own repositories, as well as use the system package manager to work with packages that are not in its repositories.
